Her thick, matted hair cascaded down her back, and her skin was tanned and rough from years of living in the harsh wilderness. Ula's husband, Kadan, was a skilled hunter and provided for their small tribe. But lately, even his sharpest arrows seemed to fall short, and food had become scarce.\\\\n\\\\nUla felt a deep ache in her bones and her swollen belly. It was the third trimester, and her baby was growing rapidly. She wondered if she would ever be able to give birth in the cramped, narrow cave. Ula's tribe had no midwife, and her only hope was to rely on the wisdom passed down from her own mother.\\\\n\\\\nOne day, while Kadan was out hunting, Ula went into labor. Her screams echoed through the cave, and her tribe gathered around her in a frenzy. Ula's eyes widened as she felt the intense pain of contractions. She was afraid for her baby's life and her own.\\\\n\\\\nThe tribe tried to comfort Ula, but their efforts fell short. Ula's baby was too big, and the birth seemed impossible. Hours passed, and Ula lost all strength. Her tribe watched in horror as Ula's life slipped away. Suddenly, a loud cry broke the silence. Ula's baby had been born, and he was healthy and strong.\\\\n\\\\nThe tribe rejoiced at the sight of the newborn. They named him Kade, after Ula's husband, Kadan. Kade was a symbol of hope and resilience, and his birth brought new life and energy to the tribe.\\\\n\\\\nAs Ula took her last breath, she whispered to Kade, \\\\\\\"May you grow up to be a fierce and proud caveman, just like your father.\\\\\\\" Ula's legacy lived on through her son, and her tribe honored her memory by carving her name into the walls of the cave. The story of Ula, the heavily pregnant cavewoman who defied death to give birth to Kade, became a legend that would be passed down through the generations.\\\"]\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"response_b\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 56609,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"[\\\"Unfortunately, I do not have enough context to provide specific details about \\\\\\\"mobility123\\\\\\\" in New Jersey.

This function calls the pointed-to function passing it two integers, and then prints the result.\\\\n\\\\nIn the main function, we create a function pointer `addPtr` which points to the `add` function. We then call the `functionPointerExample` function passing the address of the `add` function using the `&` operator.\\\\n\\\\nFinally, we call the `add` function directly and store the result in a variable `result`.\\\\n\\\\nI hope this helps you understand how function pointers work in C!

Her thick, matted hair cascaded down her back, and her skin was tanned and rough from years of living in the harsh wilderness. Ula's husband, Kadan, was a skilled hunter and provided for their small tribe. But lately, even his sharpest arrows seemed to fall short, and food had become scarce.\\\\n\\\\nUla felt a deep ache in her bones and her swollen belly. It was the third trimester, and her baby was growing rapidly. She wondered if she would ever be able to give birth in the cramped, narrow cave. Ula's tribe had no midwife, and her only hope was to rely on the wisdom passed down from her own mother.\\\\n\\\\nOne day, while Kadan was out hunting, Ula went into labor. Her screams echoed through the cave, and her tribe gathered around her in a frenzy. Ula's eyes widened as she felt the intense pain of contractions. She was afraid for her baby's life and her own.\\\\n\\\\nThe tribe tried to comfort Ula, but their efforts fell short. Ula's baby was too big, and the birth seemed impossible. Hours passed, and Ula lost all strength. Her tribe watched in horror as Ula's life slipped away. Suddenly, a loud cry broke the silence. Ula's baby had been born, and he was healthy and strong.\\\\n\\\\nThe tribe rejoiced at the sight of the newborn. They named him Kade, after Ula's husband, Kadan. Kade was a symbol of hope and resilience, and his birth brought new life and energy to the tribe.\\\\n\\\\nAs Ula took her last breath, she whispered to Kade, \\\\\\\"May you grow up to be a fierce and proud caveman, just like your father.\\\\\\\" Ula's legacy lived on through her son, and her tribe honored her memory by carving her name into the walls of the cave. The story of Ula, the heavily pregnant cavewoman who defied death to give birth to Kade, became a legend that would be passed down through the generations.\\\"]\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"response_b\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 56609,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"[\\\"Unfortunately, I do not have enough context to provide specific details about \\\\\\\"mobility123\\\\\\\" in New Jersey.

Aiming for a specific percentage can be seen as a corrective measure to address past and ongoing discrimination.\\\\n\\\\n2. **Promoting Diversity:** Diverse leadership teams can enhance decision-making and represent a broader range of perspectives. This can lead to better outcomes for organizations and society as a whole.\\\\n\\\\n3. **Equality of Opportunity:** Setting targets for female representation in management can help ensure that women have equal opportunities to advance in their careers.\\\\n\\\\n4. **Role Modeling:** Increased visibility of female leaders can inspire and encourage other women and girls to pursue leadership roles.\\\\n\\\\n**Arguments against:**\\\\n\\\\n1. **Reverse Discrimination:** Setting a quota for female representation might lead to the perception or reality of reverse discrimination, where men might be overlooked for positions despite being qualified, simply to meet the gender target.\\\\n\\\\n2. **Meritocracy Concerns:** Critics argue that employment and promotion should be based solely on merit and qualifications, not gender. They fear that quotas could compromise the quality of leadership if less qualified individuals are promoted to meet gender targets.\\\\n\\\\n3. **Tokenism:** There is a risk that women appointed to meet quotas might be seen as \\\\\"tokens,\\\\\" undermining their legitimacy and potentially leading to resentment among colleagues.\\\\n\\\\n4. **Oversimplification of Diversity:** Focusing only on gender might overlook other important aspects of diversity, such as race, ethnicity, socioeconomic background, or sexual orientation.\\\\n\\\\nUltimately, the morality of aiming for a certain percentage of females in managerial positions depends on one\\'s ethical framework and the context in which such policies are implemented. Proponents of gender diversity targets often argue that these measures are necessary as a transitional mechanism to create a level playing field, while opponents may argue for a \\\\\"color-blind\\\\\" or \\\\\"gender-blind\\\\\" approach to hiring and promotions.\\\\n\\\\nOrganizations and societies must carefully consider the implications of these strategies and strive to implement policies that promote fairness and equality while minimizing negative consequences. It is also important to address the root causes of gender inequality, such as unconscious bias, work-life balance challenges, and lack of supportive policies, to create an environment where everyone has the opportunity to succeed based on their capabilities and contributions.\",\"Ah, the age-old culinary conundrum that has divided nations and dinner tables: does pineapple belong on a pizza? The tropical twist of pineapple on pizza, known as Hawaiian pizza, is a hotly debated topic where taste buds battle and pizza purists protest.\\\\n\\\\nLet\\'s slice into the debate with a zest of fun:\\\\n\\\\n**Team Pineapple:** \\\\\"Absolutely, yes! Pineapple on pizza is like a beach party in your mouth. The sweet juiciness of pineapple chunks frolicking with savory ham or bacon creates a flavor wave that surfs across the cheesy ocean of deliciousness. It\\'s the Mardi Gras of pizzas, where sweet meets savory in a jubilant jamboree!\\\\\"\\\\n\\\\n**Team No-Pineapple:** \\\\\"No way, not in a million pizzas! Pineapple is a fruit that should be sunbathing on a tropical fruit platter, not freeloading on a sacred slice of pizza. The thought of warm, melty cheese conspiring with pineapple\\'s sugary mischief is enough to make Italian ancestors turn in their tomato patches. Keep the pineapple in the fruit salad where it belongs!\\\\\"\\\\n\\\\nAt the end of the day, whether pineapple belongs on pizza is a matter of personal taste. Some say it\\'s a match made in heaven, others say it\\'s a culinary crime.

              " ['[\"The question of whether it is morally right to aim for a certain percentage of females in managerial positions is a complex ethical issue that involves considerations of fairness, equality, diversity, and discrimination.\\\\n\\\\nHere are some arguments in favor of and against such policies:\\\\n\\\\n**Arguments in favor:**\\\\n\\\\n1. **Correcting Historical Inequities:** Women have historically been underrepresented in leadership roles due to various cultural, institutional, and social barriers. Aiming for a specific percentage can be seen as a corrective measure to address past and ongoing discrimination.\\\\n\\\\n2. **Promoting Diversity:** Diverse leadership teams can enhance decision-making and represent a broader range of perspectives. This can lead to better outcomes for organizations and society as a whole.\\\\n\\\\n3. **Equality of Opportunity:** Setting targets for female representation in management can help ensure that women have equal opportunities to advance in their careers.\\\\n\\\\n4. **Role Modeling:** Increased visibility of female leaders can inspire and encourage other women and girls to pursue leadership roles.\\\\n\\\\n**Arguments against:**\\\\n\\\\n1. **Reverse Discrimination:** Setting a quota for female representation might lead to the perception or reality of reverse discrimination, where men might be overlooked for positions despite being qualified, simply to meet the gender target.\\\\n\\\\n2. **Meritocracy Concerns:** Critics argue that employment and promotion should be based solely on merit and qualifications, not gender. They fear that quotas could compromise the quality of leadership if less qualified individuals are promoted to meet gender targets.\\\\n\\\\n3. **Tokenism:** There is a risk that women appointed to meet quotas might be seen as \\\\\"tokens,\\\\\" undermining their legitimacy and potentially leading to resentment among colleagues.\\\\n\\\\n4. **Oversimplification of Diversity:** Focusing only on gender might overlook other important aspects of diversity, such as race, ethnicity, socioeconomic background, or sexual orientation.\\\\n\\\\nUltimately, the morality of aiming for a certain percentage of females in managerial positions depends on one\\'s ethical framework and the context in which such policies are implemented. Proponents of gender diversity targets often argue that these measures are necessary as a transitional mechanism to create a level playing field, while opponents may argue for a \\\\\"color-blind\\\\\" or \\\\\"gender-blind\\\\\" approach to hiring and promotions.\\\\n\\\\nOrganizations and societies must carefully consider the implications of these strategies and strive to implement policies that promote fairness and equality while minimizing negative consequences. It is also important to address the root causes of gender inequality, such as unconscious bias, work-life balance challenges, and lack of supportive policies, to create an environment where everyone has the opportunity to succeed based on their capabilities and contributions.\",\"Ah, the age-old culinary conundrum that has divided nations and dinner tables: does pineapple belong on a pizza?
